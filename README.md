# Lyric Hunter

This project was built so users can search a artist and the song by them and it will return the lyrics if available. The app is built with ReactJS, and CSS. Lyric Hunter uses [Lyrics.ovh's](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#) API to process the users search and returns the lyrics if it finds the song if not the app will display a error message and insist the user to make a new search.
